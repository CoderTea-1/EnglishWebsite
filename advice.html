            Academic matter, but so does your mental health
          </h2>

          <p class="c-hotels__item-excerpt">
High school is all about grades. Don’t believe anyone tell you otherwise. However, it is important not to burn out. Try to be in bed before 10pm, that is always a good start. If anything blindsides you, talk with your teacher about it. Teachers are often very accommodating if you come talk with them.

Initiative          </h2>

          <p class="c-hotels__item-excerpt">
In everything that you do, take initiative. Show the teacher that you care. Even if it is just raising your hand to answer a question, this will pay off in the long run. This will almost always keep you on your teacher’s good side, which will allow you to not face as uphill of a battle if you need anything (for example, you have to miss class).

Internships          </h2>

          <p class="c-hotels__item-excerpt">
I know this sounds dumb, but start getting internships. Many of these things other freshmen are not thinking about, which will give you an edge. Don’t worry if it is minor stuff for now. Use these experiences to learn new skills, and build upon your resume. In the end, it will lead to great experiences that will help you get into college.

College Essays
          </h2>

          <p class="c-hotels__item-excerpt">
Start now. That is my advice. Start writing simple essays about things about you that answer personal statement questions. This will make your life so much easier when you actually need to write college essays and are juggling 5 APs senior year.

Friends          </h2>

          <p class="c-hotels__item-excerpt">
This is honestly the hardest thing for me to give advice on, since I haven’t been able to get it down to a tea. But first of all, trust no one. A lot of people who are smart will walk all over you the first moment you get. So many people will steal your ideas as their own. A lot of friendships collapse during sophomore year because of this.
This also extends into trying to fit in. Don’t. Be your true self. The whole popularity contest of high school is overrated. Once you are at the top, you are playing King of the Hill. The higher you go, the more false accusations are thrown your way.

Time Management
          </h2>

          <p class="c-hotels__item-excerpt">
You should never have freetime. You should never have “breaks”. You should never be doing nothing. As soon as you fill these “voids” in your schedule, life will get so much easier, where you actually have time after homework is done to have fun.
