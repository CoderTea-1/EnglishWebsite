                     <h4 class="timeline-title">Freshman Year</h4>
                     <p class="timeline-text">Going to school after COVID was a big change. I went in as a student living in San Francisco who was constantly hopping around different elementary and middle schools trying to be the best student I could to online school where effort didn’t matter. Obviously during this time, laziness became a big issue. I would stop doing school work, stop going to class.
                        This ultimately led to me being unable to get accepted to any high school. I was forced to find a good public high school in the state where I could continue my education. This led me to come to Torrey Pines High school.
                        Going into the first day of school, I was a failure. Unlike my peers, I was forced to move to high school. I was forced to go into an environment very different from the sense of normalcy I had in the Bay Area into a conservative hotspot as an Asian off the heels of COVID. Many kids saw me still with my mask and pointed fingers; made anti-Asian remarks. This was my new normal.
                        One mistake I made in entering TP was deciding to take easier classes, not to push myself. I thought that this would allow me to better transition. Wrong. This only put me in classes with kids I disagreed with, was uncomfortable with. I finally got into a rhythm of trying after COVID only to be hit with laziness again due to the classes being too easy.
                        The only community I found myself enjoying was robotics. This was an area where I could interact with smart juniors and seniors, and learn about programming. However, looking back, this was only a cesspool of bullying too. The president was manipulative and loved scapegoating others for his problems. As a new freshman on the team, I often took the brunt of the blame.

                     <h4 class="timeline-title">Sophomore Year</h4>
                     <p class="timeline-text">Sophomore year was the year of robotics. I had just been elected the Director of Operations of the team and was ecstatic. We finally got to World Champs this year, making me realize my accomplishments. I was still drinking the kool-aid of the others, but I started to see the cracks.
                        For once in robotics, I wasn’t the wide-eyed freshman asking everyone for help; I was the one helping. There was a new sense of leadership and responsibility. I had decided late into freshman year to challenge myself more in terms of classes during sophomore year.
                        Being a sophomore is a middle realm – not quite a new student, yet not fully grasping the task at hand. I knew the ropes, but I was still working on walking with confidence. I needed to push myself to the limits to see how much I could handle. I was living on the rails.
                        Yet, I pushed too hard and crashed into the wall by the end of the year. I had a record about of low grades, along with a plethora of teachers who now hated me. I wasn’t managing my time well, I wasn’t sleeping much, and I was barely keeping up the front of someone in control. It was humbling, to say the least.
                        Despite all the setbacks, the year helped me learn a lot about myself. I learned by limits on academics, along with learning that leadership isn’t just about stepping up—it’s about knowing when to step back. I learned that stretching yourself is important, but so is balance, and that burnout isn’t a badge of honor.
                        Looking back, sophomore year wasn’t just about robotics or failing. This year was about learning how to fail, reflect, and grow. The experience reshaped how I define success—not as perfection, but as resilience.

                     <h4 class="timeline-title">Junior Year</h4>
                     <p class="timeline-text">Everyone says that you need to start thinking about college in junior year.
I beg to differ.
	Thinking about college needs to start before junior year.
My junior year was when I turned all my experiences into action. I had finally got an internship the summer before in Ghana working at both Amnesty International and Legal Aid.
I finally used my summer to learn. Learn about the slave trade. How to make friends. How to deal with opposing viewpoints. How to start being independent. Start thinking about my future.
When I came back, I was presented with an opportunity. The opportunity to co-found a non-profit organization with someone I met in Ghana helping children in the area. For once in my life, I turned an experience into action. Along with help from some friends, I started a robotics team in Accra, and built this new non-profit organization from the ground up.
Balancing this with all my classes was challenging. I was taking AP Art History, AP Seminar, and AP Bio, all this year. First semester was rough. I was overwhelmed and unsure how to balance all these classes. I was able to get a wrangle on everything, but I ended up burning out a lot, along with generally not feeling great. However, something clicked in the second semester. I began managing my time better, setting priorities, and learning how to compartmentalize. My grades improved, but more than that, my confidence did.
But with life, everything balances itself out. While I was building confidence, it was being torn down by seeing all my friends who were a year older than me struggle to get into college. I saw all my friends start to fade, going into their own pit of despair, and knowing that I would lose them.

                     <h4 class="timeline-title">Senior Year</h4>
                     <p class="timeline-text">Senior year is all about reflection. After years of pushing forward, chasing leadership titles, packing my schedule with APs, and constantly trying to prove something, I finally had the space to stop and ask: who am I really becoming?
My time in Cape Town allowed me to self-reflect. Who was I? During this time, I realized that I was a mean, twisted version of myself; someone I never wanted to be. I had become impatient, defensive, and obsessed with being right. I wore stress like armor and pushed people away before they could see me fall apart.
But in Cape Town, I was surrounded by great people. I was forced to be vulnerable and didn’t have classwork to hide behind. I didn’t have grades or clubs to worry about. It was me, myself, and a bunch of med students.
They showed me experiences I never thought I would find myself in. They helped me come out of this cocoon of defensiveness in the face of fear. They forced me to confront my regret, popped my bubble about people around me. They showed me how you can be loved and supported, not because you’re achieving something, but because you’re human. I let my guard down. I laughed more. I listened more. I was finally just me.
But when I came back, I realized that high school is never a place where these things can happen or be supported. I looked around at my peers, seeing a reflection of the person I used to be. Senior year became less about accomplishments and more about presence. I worked to rebuild damaged friendships, to be gentler with myself, to lead with humility instead of pressure.
Yes, this led me into meeting people that I now regret. But it is important to learn that there is a lesson to be learned in all these experiences.
