        const poemText = `\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw it. An old briefcase, its leather cracked from age and showing signs of use. As a young kid, I am not yet tall enough to reach the top shelf where the briefcase lies. I look around, grabbing a white step stool my mother uses as a chair in her closet. As I pull it off the shelf, the weight surprises me. I stumble down the stepstool, only to clumsily dropped onto my toe. I winced in pain, but my curiosity overshadowed it. What was this 40, maybe 50 years old relic of the past doing in my mother's closet? More importantly, what lay inside this heavy, locked mystery?\n\nIt was much later that I asked my parents about this mysterious item that was stashed away in their closet. To my surprise, it was not some spy briefcase from my parent’s double life, as I imagined as a kid. Instead, it belonged to another person with a unique life, my halaboji (grandfather). \n\nWe had lost him quite a bit back, a time when I was still learning how to add and subtract. I did not know my grandfather’s work as a North Korean serving the South Korean army in the Korean War. I didn’t know what a cold war was or that there were other colonels besides Colonel Sanders. My little mind couldn’t comprehend the idea of discrimination or the idea of corruption. However, these were all things that came with that suitcase.\n\nWorking for the enemy is shunned in any country. Being a North Korean in the South Korean army in the midst of the Korean War was especially hard. Despite both my grandfather and his younger brother attempting to escape, only one survived, with the latter being drafted for the North Korean military. Knowing that you could any day face your brother in the heat of battle and have to be the one to kill him always stings. Or even worse, someone else kills him. Ever since he enlisted, my grandfather would always be the odd one out; not just physically, as he was described as “scrawny” by his officers, but also socially, as he was the “enemy”. Eventually, he was forced to the back of the kitchen, working in the heat to feed those who he knew would kill his brother, family, and friends. Even after the war, despite being praised by high-ranking UN officials, he never was able to become a general, restricted to Colonel; the guy who worked in the kitchen. When he finally was recognized for his work, he was asked to shell out over 5 thousand won in bribes, equivalent to over 100,000 won today, a sum he couldn’t pay. As I grew older, I not only became the inheritor of his genes but also the briefcase, with all the lessons attached. Lessons that still need to be learned today.\n\nFrom a young age, these lessons were slowly passed down to me, like water dripping from a leaky pipe. One of the first times that I started learning from my past was in 2014. On April 16, 2014, a ship capsized off the coast of Korea. Despite fishing boats ready to rush in to help save the passengers, they were warded off by sharks circling in the water with Korean Coast Guard painted on the side. Despite the ship actively sinking, the boats and passengers onboard were told to hold on, to wait for everything to fix itself. While all this was happening, the president was alerted and went into emergency mode, getting “beautified up” for the meeting with the coast guard on what to do. In the end, over 300 high school students died due to mismanagement on many levels. The same government that 40 years ago was asking for kickbacks to get a well-regarded colonel to a general, kicked back and watched the lives of over 300 students get their futures ended. That is why I decided to get on the street to bring to light the injustices faced by these students who were only 8 years older than me. Despite being too young to recognize it, I was becoming the teacher of the lessons my grandfather passed down to me.
As I have grown up, I have only seen more and more examples of the same issues my grandfather faced over 40 years ago. \n\nOn June 14, 2017, Grenfell Tower, which was located between the posh London neighborhoods of Kensington and Chelsea, faced a small house fire after a fridge freezer caught on fire. This old concrete tower was the government’s answer to a large amount of South Asian migrants entering the UK. Through government mismanagement, the fact that the paint used to help insulate the building, which was not built for mass housing, was flammable slipped through the cracks leading to 72 people dying after being told to “not move” and to wait for assistance. This echo of the past not only showed how governmental mismanagement stemmed far beyond Korea but also showed another injustice that is faced by my grandfather, along with many others today; xenophobia. Despite 40 years passing since my grandfather faced racial discrimination in the Korean military, it persists to this day, not just being about the “enemy”, but just that you “are not me”.\n\nBut this culture doesn’t end with developed countries. This culture has been passed down from generation to generation, pushed by colonization and killing. I was lucky to go to South Africa during the summer of 2024, where I saw firsthand how migrants, especially those of lower socioeconomic status were being discriminated against. One of the most glaring examples was just a few blocks down from my well-to-do housing. On the main street in my neighborhood, there exists a metal shack city. To the untrained eye, one might assume that these are just the homeless who migrated into the neighborhood from lower-income neighborhoods. However, once you peel back the curtain, you realize that this metal shack city used to be a high-rise, helping support those in the community. During COVID, the builder shut it down without giving their tenants a suitable alternative. This left many without homes, trapped in a metaphorical box of rise-buildings to its right, mall to its left, a cemetery in the rear, and a 6-lane highway in the front. Many tenets are stuck in this box today, constantly being woken by the hustle and bustle of the industrious neighborhood.\n\nWhile giving food or money may be a good temporary solution, I aim to create greater change. Armed with my grandfather’s suitcase in one hand and my book of knowledge in the other, I aim to learn as much as I can from my education here in the US before applying it abroad.
